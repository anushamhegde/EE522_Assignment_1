 # Assignment 1 
 ## Objective
 The Objective of the assignment is to build and configure the embedded development environment for the raspberry pi.  In this assignment the goal is to learn the basics of hardware and software part of the raspberry pi and troubleshooting the problems that encountered during the initial set up.

 ## Procedure
 1. Set up the raspberry pi board with all the equipmemts provided starting with the box to encase, connecting fan, connecting to keyboard mouse to USB port. Connect to desktop(HDMI0) and power supply. 
 2. Inserting the MicroSD card after the first step.
 3. Switching on the power to the raspberry pi board. The MicroSD should have already be preloaded with NOOBS in it. But for me it was not working and I got the rainbow splash screen in the desktop. I ensured everything was connected properly.
 4. I referred to www.canakit.com/pi/recovery to get details on what needs to be done.
 5. Installed Raspberry pi Imager to install the Operating system Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit Bullseye version into the MicroSD card using my Mac.
 6. After OS has been installed to my MicroSD I connected that back to raspberry pi board and I got the first page in my desktop to select the Language and time zone. 
 7. Using $ sudo raspi -config command choose the console auto login option.
